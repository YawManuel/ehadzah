            Madina, Ghana’s Silicone Valley

        <!-- Article body -->
        <article class="main-content">
            Is now a boom in the software world with lot and lot of tech companies, from Giant tech companies to Unicorn
            level to numerous of coding bootcamps in the world now. Does Ghana have it share of such tech establishment?
            Let’s take our travelling lenses and world map and have a look at our new Unicorn tech Community in the
            world, Madina. <br>
            <div></div>
            It all started with the yahoo boys with the springing of internet cafes all over the place. I can still
            remember my first email, which was a Yahoo mail. How fun and important you were if you own an email during
            those days. Computers were becoming popular in the Madina communities with internet cafes opening up
            everywhere, where its number one patronizes were the yahoo boys. People went into the cafes to chat with
            clients through Yahoo Messenger, there wasn’t much learning done on the internet by users by then. This was
            around 2004-2007 where most schools did not have computers, also it was very difficult to get a home with a
            computer. So, schools will take their students to large internet cafes to have a feel of it and learn how to
            use it, my first computer usage experience was when our school took us to an internet café, this was when I
            was in primary. The internet cafes were really the genesis and the driving force of computer literacy in the
            communities which has become now Ghana’s Silicon Valley.
            <br>
            <div></div>
            Madina being the hub of great schools, things started to change from 2008 when junior high schools and
            senior high schools started having their own computer labs; computers started to be available in most homes;
            introduction of smart phones and the springing up of special form of internet cafes for training students
            how to use computers. These changes took the crown from the yahoo boys to the academicians as the most
            computer users. My family and I left Madina in 2010, so I missed 9 years of personal experience when the
            table turned in 2008, though I seldom visit Madina to observe the rampant development in the communities in
            Madina.
            <br>

            <div></div>
            In University, I had little hope for the country in terms of digital technology development. But not until I
            completed school and started applying for tech roles and realise my tech job hunting radar was always
            pointing to Madina. Whats is happening in my Madina? So, I did ground research of the number of tech
            companies, coding bootcamps, startups, and I found out that, the lost hope I was having can be found in
            Madina, my Madina. Is incredible to see how just within 9 years Madina has turn into a tech hub, once a
            community with internet cafes all over the place led by yahoo boys is now a tech city with tech companies,
            coding bootcamps, fintech companies, startups led by Academicians, technocrats, students, investors. Most of
            these companies are software-oriented companies, generally Ghana don’t have big computer hardware tech
            companies, but mostly repairs and some assembling of laptops. Circle Tip Toe Lane being the number one spot
            to get all your computer brands and all kind of Computer accessories to buy, where they also assemble
            laptops. Madina is catching up with hardware related tech companies, but for now, is all software-oriented
            companies. <br>
            <div></div>

            With the future of the expansion of Ghana’s silicon Valley, Koforidua in Eastern region and Ho in the Volta
            region looks promising. For this is when the tech companies in Madina starts expanding and need real-estate
            to expand the company workspace.
