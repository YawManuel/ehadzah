            COVID-19, World Business former CEO: Was a Showman Boss CEO or just a Commoner

        <article class="main-content">
            Is been almost three years now since the world had a new CEO in World Business. Showing us how to run our
            co-operations, manage our human resource. COVID-19 a Show-Man or a Commoner? <br>
            <div></div>
            TStruggling companies in these times will see it as a Commoner, but successful growing companies in these
            times sees COVID-19 as a Showman CEO. Must we listen to the orders of this new CEO? Yes. For your company to
            survive in these times and prevent your employees from joining the great resignation currently going on,
            then you need to go by the business executive orders of the Boss COVID-19.
            <br>
            <div></div>
            First COVID-19 executive order, is your company going remote or hybrid. The outbreak of COVID-19 has brought
            out the pile of filths under the carpet of the business world. Stress, burnout, mental health are all filths
            that if company managers and owners fail to clean from their workers and their workplace, they will end up
            losing workers and even top-level executive members. The only way to clean this filth from their workers and
            keep talents in their companies is to go remote or practice a hybrid system of workplace where you run an
            on-site and remote workspace in your company.
            <br>

            <div></div>
            Worker’s health benefits have been neglected for so long by most tech companies, but now is a COVID-19
            executive order that all tech companies must execute in their companies if they want to survive as a
            company. Mental health vacations; sleeping pod for nap that some companies have started implementing;
            employees tour, which can be organized once in every quarter of the year should be practiced.

            <div></div>
            Yes, data is the new oil, but protecting and respecting consumers data should be the main priority of every
            company. Refusal to implement this COVID-19 executive order can result in you losing consumers and even your
            software engineers. There are some software companies that have lost their software engineers because they
            failed to respect consumers data. Sound strange when you hear this, but there is one thing every tech owner
            or CEO should know is that: the software developers’ community have developed a developer advocate that
            moves to protect tech consumers right and data from being breached and violated. <br>

            Bitcoin and its friends are charging bulls from the wild wild west attracting cowboys around the world, so
            get your cowboy hat and keep your feet strong and firm on the ground as you ride in the new free world.
