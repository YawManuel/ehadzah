            Moments of Euphoria, pride and looking for your High School badge to hit your chest and boost around your
            peers and say "am a proud alumnus" when your school take the crown as the best brains of the National
            Science and Maths Quiz (NSMQ). The NSMQ has been with us since 1993 when Kwaku Mensa-Bonsu, then Managing
            Director of Primetime; the late Professors Marian Ewurama Addy and Ebenezer Kweku Awotwe were playing tennis
            on the court of the University of Ghana, Legon when Mr. Mensa-Bonsu was watching a bird stand on a live
            electric wire and <span style="color: red">got hit by curiosity on why birds could stand on a live electric wire without getting
            electrocuted, but human beings could not do same. From Prof. Awotwe’s explanation, Mr. Mensa-Bonsu was awed
            with the answer to his curiosity and got the idea of putting together a quiz programme on science and maths</span> 
            to educate the general public about science and inspire children, youth and even of the old age to pursue
            the study of science in order for everyone to understand the environment around us. Since then, the National
            Science & Maths Quiz (NSMQ) has seen 25 exciting editions. With the just 2019 edition where Newton led
            Augusco to victory with his Newton first law of motion to victory in which Presec failed to hit Newton hard
            with their Odadie to stop Newton motion to victory with no interruptions.
            <br>
            <div></div>

            "Augusco should keep our trophy well, we are coming for it next year (2020)." Presec kept to their word and
            in thy ligh, they really the saw light and took the trophy back from Cape Coast to Legon-Madina, GT Accra in
            this NSMQ edition. The Competition was between the Presbyterian boys High School the Odadie, from
            Legon-Madina in Greater Accra; Adisadel College, known as the Zebras from Cape Coast, Central Region and
            Opoku Ware (Owass) the Akatakyie from Ashanti region. The contest comes in five rounds: round 1 which is the
            round of fundamental questions where each contesting school has to answer 4 Biology, 4 Chemistry, 4 Physics
            and 4 Mathematics questions; round 2 called the speed race. All three schools are presented with same
            questions at the same time and a school answers a question by ringing the bell; round 3 round is known as
            the Problem of the day. The contestants are required to solve a single question, worth 10 points, within 4
            minutes;
            round 4 True or False statements are given to the contestants. The objective is to determine whether each
            statement is true or false and finally round 5 Riddles where clues are given.
            <br>
            <div></div>

            Presec legon won all the rounds. In the first round Owass became second with 9 points, Adisco third with 7
            points and Presec first with 14 points. On the second round, the Noble round, Noble with his ringing bell
            took Owass to the second position with 8 points, Adisco with 7 points and Presec winning with 18 points. On
            the third round, Owass became third with 14 points, Adisco second with 15 points and Presec first with 23
            points. On round 4, Owass had 18 points, Mbebo pushed Adisco to the second position with 28 points and
            Presec wining with 33 points. At this stage, you’ve been wondering what has been making Presec win the
            rounds? Gakpetor had been the Newton in this year competition, helped propelled the <span style="color: red;">Odadie to victory with
            36 points at the final round.</span> With Adisco rounding up with 31 points as second and Owass being third with 21
            points. A big congratulations to Benjamin, Isaac and Gakpetor for winning the NSMQ 2020 for the Presbyterian
            boys and Legon-Madina.
            <br>
            <div></div>

            There is plan for expansion of such a quiz, where in 2007, a West African version of the programme, named
            the West African Science and Maths Quiz (for Anglophone West Africa) was launched in Accra. The maiden
            edition featured three (3) teams each from Ghana and Nigeria and went down very well. The maiden edition was
            won by Ghana. However, due to sponsorship issues, the programme could not be sustained beyond its first
            year, although the organisers hope to fully bring the programme back to it feet. In the near future,
            Primetime also expect to build a Science Fair component to the programme, so as to make it a Science and
            Maths Festival, which would then become even bigger and more interesting for the students and schools to
            participate in. This would encourage students to put what they learn in their classrooms to practice and
            thus help them become innovative. We hope and pray 'brilla', nickname and popularly known among High School
            Students, changes the bad scope of science and technology environment we have in Ghana. Congrats! once more,
            to the Odadies. Should we start to talk about 7?
