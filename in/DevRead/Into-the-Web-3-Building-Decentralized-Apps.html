            The problem with getting a job fresh out of coding bootcamp, school or a being a self-taught is that
            everyone who hires you is looking for experience. But how will you get experience without being hired?
            Experience is important because regardless of the company you work for, an experienced engineer will
            understand many things students don't. like
            <ul>
                <li>how to solve problems on your own without the full assistance of your friends or teachers</li>
                <li>how to check your work to make sure there are almost never any errors with it</li>
                <li>how to explain your work and how you think about problems in clear English</li>
                <li>how to collaborate with engineers and non-technical people alike</li>
                <li>how to read and understand large codebases well enough to fix problems with them</li>
            </ul>
            Having these skills mean you will be able to make or save the company more money than your salary costs
            them. That's the bottom line with a company.

            <span style="text-decoration: double;">Part 1: Getting an interview</span>
            <br>
            Getting the interview
            I've been in charge of hiring decisions a few times, and it's helped me understand what interviewer and
            hiring committees are looking for. Before taking up valuable time with an interview, they want to know,
            really quickly, whether you can write code that works. The fastest way for them to do this is:
          <ul>
            <li>Have a Github account with at least 3 projects pinned to the top of your profile page</li> 
            <li>Each project should have a README.md file that explains What the project does</li> 
            <li>A link to your fully-working project</li> 
            <li>Any setup instructions for getting the project working on a new machine. (This is kind of optional, but
                good to have.)</li> 
         </ul>

                alt="">

            <figcaption>Image showing a README.md file</figcaption> <br>
            <!-- <span class="wordenlight">  -->
            If you can check all these boxes, you've greatly enhanced your chances of getting an interview. It's so rare
            to find a candidate who's done all the above, if I came across such a candidate, I would at least set up a
            phone interview for us to talk further.
            Bonus points if you have a portfolio website that hosts working examples of your projects. A blog on your
            portfolio website that also shows that you know how to write about technology in a clear way is also another
            big plus.

            <br>
            <div></div>
            <span style="text-decoration: double;">Part 2: How to pass an interview</span>
            <br>
            Once you've been invited to interview with a company, you'll have some or all of the following to do: a
            take-home challenge; a phone screen; a live technical interview
            <br>
            The take-home challenge is having finished a lot of personal projects. Is helpful with this one because even
            if you have a lot of job experience, 80 - 90% of that time was probably spent fixing bugs and not building
            things. How so? If you're joining a company that is making enough money to hire new engineers, the
            money-making code has long since been written. They most likely need the new engineers to help maintain and
            protect that code. Still, they will give prospective engineers a small project to write or extend as their
            take-home challenge. The skills to do well on this will come from writing and extending similarly-small
            projects, practice you will only get on your own.
            Sometimes the take-home challenge will be an algorithms or data structures question from a site like
            Hackerrank.com. Be sure to try out Hackerrank.com and similar sites to get a feel for the interface as well
            as practice with the sorts of problems they ask.

            <div></div>
            A phone screen. Be eager to please, but not too eager to please. I know, this hard advice to follow and a
            fine line to walk. I think the trick here is sincerity. One way to approach this is to take a look at the
            business you're applying to and find something about it that genuinely interests you. That way, when asked
            if you have any questions, you can draw on that genuine interest and ask questions about the business. Also,
            if you're genuinely interested in tech, it will naturally show. Here, my advice for discovering your passion
            in tech is to be curious. Always be asking yourself questions. Try to answer these questions on your own and
            in your own way. Some of these questions will be things no one has thought about, and when you discover
            answers, a genuine passion for technology will start to blossom.
            They may ask technical questions here, quite often about prior experiences or projects. Come into the
            interview with a relevant project to talk about. That project, if it's one you did on your own, should
            probably have been complex enough to include tests you wrote for it. If possible, also have a user (like a
            friend) try it out and give you advice.

            <br>
            <div></div>
            A live technical interview. For a front-end role, they will possibly ask you to make a small application on
            the fly. Like writing a search page that responds to a user's search term with a list of news results
            containing that term. Once again, having done a lot of personal projects helps with having the ins and outs
            of building apps at a moment's notice at your fingertips.
            For a back-end role, they will probably limit you to an algorithm or data structures question. Front-end
            roles often include such a question as well. Here, practice makes man perfect. Here is a list of topics you
            should feel comfortable with to be reasonably well-prepared for such questions: Data structures, Big O
            Notation, Trees, Sorting and search algorithms, Arrays, Hash tables.
