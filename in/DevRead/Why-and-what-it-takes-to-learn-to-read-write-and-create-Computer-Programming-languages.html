        <article class="main-content">
            There are six languages every person needs to learn in this world. Mother or father tongue; English
            language; Computer Programming language (digital language); scientific language (scientific names, science
            symbols) and sign language. But Computer programming language stands out among all the three in this
            civilized digital world. Wow, why? What’s special about programming languages, what’s it uses for and how do
            I get started? <br>
            <div></div>

            Computer Programming languages were created by humans for humans to be able to interact with computers.
            There are over hundreds of computer programming languages, which are categorized into Machine language, Low
            Level languages and High-Level languages. Machine language is what Low-Level languages and High-Level
            languages sits on and are being converted to Machine language for a computer to understand. A computer only
            understands a Machine language, which are the ASCI (the ‘1’ and ‘0’) where compilers and interpreters are
            built to convert these Low- and High-level languages to Machine language for the computers to understand.

            <!-- <span class="wordenlight">  -->
            Example of Low-level programming languages are: C, Assembler, COBOL, Fortran, Pascal, Lisp, and so on. They
            are called Low-level languages, because it sits directly on the computer hardware and is closer to the
            computer machine language than High-Level language. With Low-Level languages, you write a lot of scripts to
            perform a task whilst with High-Level languages, you write less code to perform a task. With it tedious of
            writing much lines of code before you can complete a task, High-level languages were created to write less
            lines of code to quickly spin off a software with less time in writing codes. Examples of High-Level
            languages are: Javascript (JS), Python, C# (CSharp), Java, php and so on. High-Level languages are mostly
            written in with Low-Level languages
            <br>
            <div></div>

            Where can I write a programmed language? You can write it anywhere and anything that you can write on, but
            if you want to write and execute your scripts, there are special editors and tools you need to use and write
            on in order to execute your code after writing it. Code and scripts? Don’t get confuse, they are the same
            <br>

                the Moon standing next to the Codes (written in Assembly language) to control the space craft to land on
                the moon.</figcaption> <br>
            At first, programmers (software engineers) use to write their codes on punch cards and run it through a
            computer to execute the codes. Then console editors were born to write codes on; followed by graphical text
            editors; IDEs (Integrated Development Environment) and now we have code editors like the most used, VS Code.
            These tools quickly help you to write codes to create a software or use it for data analysis. You can get
            all of these tools on the internet and download for free use. As a beginner, I would recommend you to start
            writing High-Level languages, for they are easy to learn and beginner friendly syntax (parameters to follow
            to write codes). Where you can use the High-Level languages to easily spin-off a website, mobile apps,
            Games, desktop applications, console apps, software and perform data analysis
            <div></div>

            One maybe a game maniac and would love to create one, then you going to use game engines like Unity game
            engine, unreal game engine and co by using languages like C# (CSharp), C++, Javascript etc to create. You
            may also be fascinated by the mobile apps on your phone, love to create one? Then you learn the iOS App
            development technology stack(Swift language, iOS framework, Xcode) to develop apps on the iOS platform and
            the Android App development stack(Java or Kotlin language, android framework, android studio) to develop
            apps on the android OS. You can also use cross-platform development tools like (React-Native, Flutter) to
            develop mobile apps on both iOS and android OS . You may also be a Data nerd and would love to do data
            manipulations on your own? You can use Jupyter Notebook with python to do your data analysis magic. Is easy
            to achieve all these, if only you are ready to put in the Time and Effort. It takes time and effort to be a
            computer programmer, with a minimum of 18 months to have a grasp on coding. But with all, you pick one field
            and start with. <br>
            <div></div>

            Learning to code as a newbie can be frustrating and tough. To take off the frustration and speed code, you
            need to get a mentor, follow coding camps (online and offline) you can follow the free and largest popular
            online coding bootcamp on twitter with the hashtag: #100DaysOfCode to learn more coding and coding tips from
            the industry experts. Freecodecamp.org, Khan Academy, Traversymedia, Academind, TheNetNinja, Code with Ania
            Kubow, CodeHawkes are some examples of free online coding Websites and Youtube channels to learn coding on
            your own and self-pace. But if you are above 30 years old and a family man who wants to learn to code to
            switch career into the software industry, then will advise you to join a paid bootcamp in your community or
            near your community to speed code into your software career since learning to code on your own takes a lot
            of time to learn than a paid bootcamp where they structure your learning curriculum for you. <div></div>

            Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the tech industry has been in wild need of software engineers than ever in
            history. This is because companies are going remote and businesses are held and run on the internet, giving
            rise for the need for software engineers to develop companies digital platforms for them. Last year, big
            tech companies had a tough time in hiring due to scarcity of software engineers. The world need software
            engineers, but hey, don’t rush yourself into it if is solely because of money, because you will not find
            happiness for yourself. Mental health is very important in this field, so let passion lead, for with passion
            you will find happiness as a software engineer as you make your big bounty money. Have the passion? Then
            will recommend you start with these programing languages: Javascript, Python, C# (CSharp) and Go, since
            these are the top most needed programming languages in 2022 by tech companies. <br>
